# 🚀 Welcome to The Don’t Panic Protocol

## 🔒 Cybersecurity Simplified  

Hi there! I’m Mike, the developer behind **The Don’t Panic Protocol**, your trusted guide to securing your digital life. In a world where cyber threats feel as unavoidable as taxes, this project is here to make cybersecurity simple, effective, and—dare I say it—fun.

## 📋 What’s This All About?  

The Don’t Panic Protocol is a beginner-friendly cybersecurity guide designed for home users, small businesses, and anyone feeling overwhelmed by digital safety. Launching **November 24, 2024**, this site will feature:  
- **Step-by-step guides** to keep your accounts safe.

## 🛡️ Your Mission (Should You Choose to Accept It)  

Here’s how to get started:  

1. **Take Inventory**  
   Write down all your accounts, subscriptions, and devices. Understanding your “digital footprint” is step one in protecting it.  

2. **Gather Passwords**  
   Use a secure password manager (like [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com)) to store, organize, and generate strong passwords.

- Watch for suspicious emails and links.  
- Report and delete anything questionable.  

### 4️⃣ Step 4: Update Your Software
