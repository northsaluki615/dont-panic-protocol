### 🔑 **Authentication**  

The process of verifying that a user or device is who they claim to be before granting access to a system. Common methods include:  

- Passwords  
- Biometrics (like fingerprints)  
- Multifactor authentication (MFA)  

**Why it matters:** Authentication is your first line of defense against unauthorized access.

### 🛡️ **Cybersecurity**  

The art of protecting systems, networks, and data from attacks. Cybersecurity focuses on three key areas:  

- Confidentiality: Keeping your information private.  
- Integrity: Ensuring data isn’t altered.  
- Availability: Making sure your data is accessible when you need it.  

**Why it matters:** Every device and network you use benefits from strong cybersecurity practices.

### 🌐 **Digital Footprint**  

The trail of data you leave behind when you go online. This includes:  

- Social media posts  
- Websites you visit  
- Purchases and subscriptions  

**Pro Tip:** Use private browsing modes and clear your cookies to minimize your footprint.

### 🔐 **Encryption**  

The practice of scrambling data to make it unreadable without a key. Encryption ensures data stays secure during:  

- File storage  
- Online communication (look for HTTPS in your browser)  

**Why it matters:** It’s the reason cybercriminals can’t read your messages or steal your credit card info during transactions.

### 👾 **Malware**  

Short for "malicious software," malware is designed to harm your devices or steal your data. Common types include:  

- Viruses: Infect files and spread.  
- Ransomware: Locks your files and demands payment.  
- Spyware: Secretly gathers information.  

**Pro Tip:** Install antivirus software and run regular scans to keep malware at bay.

### 🔒 **Multifactor Authentication (MFA)**  

An extra layer of security that requires two or more steps to verify your identity, such as:  

- A password  
- A fingerprint or face scan  
- A one-time code sent to your phone  

**Pro Tip:** Always enable MFA for important accounts like email and banking.

### 🎣 **Phishing**  

A scam where attackers pose as trusted entities (like your bank) to trick you into revealing sensitive information. Phishing attempts often come through:  

- Email  
- Text messages  
- Fake websites  

**How to spot it:** Look for typos, suspicious URLs, and unexpected requests for personal data.

### 💸 **Ransomware**  

Malware that locks your files and demands payment (a ransom) to release them.  
**How to avoid it:**  

- Back up your files regularly.  
- Avoid clicking on unknown links or downloading suspicious attachments.

### 🕵️ **Social Engineering**  

A tactic that manipulates people into giving up private information. Examples include:  

- Phishing  
- Pretexting (creating fake scenarios to gain trust)  
- Tailgating (following someone into a secure area)  

**Why it matters:** Cybersecurity isn’t just about tech—it’s about people, too.

### 🌐 **Virtual Private Network (VPN)**  

A service that encrypts your internet connection and hides your IP address, making your browsing activity private.  
**Pro Tip:** Use a VPN when on public Wi-Fi to prevent data interception.

### 📶 **Wi-Fi Security**  

Measures to protect your wireless network, such as:  

- Enabling WPA3 or WPA2 encryption.  
- Changing default router credentials.  
- Setting up a guest network for visitors or IoT devices.  

**Why it matters:** A secure network is the foundation of your digital safety.
