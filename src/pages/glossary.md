**🔒 Multifactor Authentication (MFA)**  
An additional layer of security that requires more than one method of authentication from independent categories of credentials to verify a user’s identity. Common forms of MFA include using a password along with a fingerprint or a one-time code.

**💸 Ransomware**  
A type of malware that encrypts a victim's files, making them inaccessible until a ransom is paid to the attacker to unlock them. Ransomware attacks are commonly used for financial extortion.

**🔒 Secure Socket Layer (SSL) / Transport Layer Security (TLS)**  
SSL and TLS are protocols for encrypting data transferred over the internet, providing a secure connection between users and websites. Look for “https” in the URL for sites with SSL/TLS protection.

**2️⃣ Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**  
A form of multifactor authentication where two separate forms of identification are required to access an account. This typically involves something the user knows (a password) and something they have (like a phone or security token).

**🌐 Virtual Private Network (VPN)**  
A service that creates a secure, encrypted connection over the internet, masking your IP address and protecting your data from being intercepted by others. VPNs are often used for privacy and to access restricted content.
