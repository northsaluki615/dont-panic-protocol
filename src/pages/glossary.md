**Authentication**  
The process of verifying the identity of a user or device before allowing access to a system. Authentication methods include passwords, biometrics, and multifactor authentication.

**Biometrics**  
Technologies that identify individuals based on unique physical characteristics, such as fingerprints or facial recognition, often used as a form of authentication.

**Malware**  
Short for "malicious software," malware includes programs like viruses, trojans, and ransomware that can harm your computer or steal data.

**Multifactor Authentication (MFA)**  
An additional layer of security that requires more than one method of authentication from independent categories of credentials to verify a user’s identity. Common forms of MFA include using a password along with a fingerprint or a one-time code.

**Password Manager**  
A software application that securely stores and manages a user’s passwords for various online accounts, often using encryption to protect them. Password managers simplify the process of using unique passwords for every account.

**Phishing**  
A type of online scam where attackers impersonate legitimate organizations to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information, like passwords or credit card numbers.

**Ransomware**  
A type of malware that encrypts a victim's files, making them inaccessible until a ransom is paid to the attacker to unlock them. Ransomware attacks are commonly used for financial extortion.

**Secure Socket Layer (SSL) / Transport Layer Security (TLS)**  
SSL and TLS are protocols for encrypting data transferred over the internet, providing a secure connection between users and websites. Look for “https” in the URL for sites with SSL/TLS protection.

**Social Engineering**  
A manipulation technique that exploits human psychology to trick people into revealing confidential information or performing actions that compromise security. Common examples include phishing and pretexting.

**Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**  
A form of multifactor authentication where two separate forms of identification are required to access an account. This typically involves something the user knows (a password) and something they have (like a phone or security token).

**Virtual Private Network (VPN)**  
A service that creates a secure, encrypted connection over the internet, masking your IP address and protecting your data from being intercepted by others. VPNs are often used for privacy and to access restricted content.

**Virus**  
A type of malware that attaches itself to legitimate programs and spreads to other programs or devices, often causing harm by corrupting data or system files.

**Vulnerability**  
A weakness in software, hardware, or a network that could be exploited by cyber attackers to gain unauthorized access to information or disrupt system functionality.

**Wi-Fi Security**  
Measures taken to secure a wireless network and prevent unauthorized access, including encryption protocols like WPA2 and WPA3. Proper Wi-Fi security helps protect devices on a home or business network.

**Zero-Day Exploit**  
A cyberattack that occurs on the same day a vulnerability is discovered and before a patch or solution is available, making it especially dangerous.
