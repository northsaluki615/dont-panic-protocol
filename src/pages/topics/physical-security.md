## üõ†Ô∏è What is it?

Physical security is the protection of your devices, data, and personal information from physical theft, damage, or unauthorized access. From securing your smartphone at a caf√© to protecting your home office, physical safeguards are an essential layer of cybersecurity.

## üö® Why is this important?

A stolen or tampered device can expose sensitive information, grant unauthorized access to accounts, or even be used to impersonate you. Physical security complements digital defenses by ensuring that your devices are secure from real-world threats.

3. **Lock Devices When Not in Use**  
   Always lock your screen or log out of accounts when stepping away from your device. Set automatic lock timers for added protection ([source](https://www.cisa.gov/secureourworld)).

4. **Protect Devices While Traveling**  
   Use padded cases to prevent damage and avoid leaving devices unattended in cars or public places. If traveling internationally, consider using a clean device without sensitive data ([source](https://www.nsa.gov)).
