## üõ†Ô∏è What is it?

Physical security refers to measures that protect your devices, data, and personal information from physical theft, tampering, or unauthorized access. Whether you're working at a coffee shop, traveling, or safeguarding your home office, physical security is an essential layer of protection that complements digital defenses.

## üö® Why is this important?

A stolen or tampered device can:  

- Expose sensitive information, photos, or financial details.  
- Grant attackers access to your accounts and data.  
- Be used to impersonate you or exploit your digital identity.  

Strong physical security measures protect against these risks by ensuring that only you can access your devices and data in real-world scenarios.
