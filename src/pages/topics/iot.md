## üõ†Ô∏è What is it?

The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to everyday devices‚Äîlike lights, refrigerators, fitness trackers, and smart doorbells‚Äîthat connect to the internet. These devices bring convenience and efficiency, but they also introduce potential vulnerabilities into your home network.

---

## üö® Why is this important?

Hackers target IoT devices because they often lack strong security measures. Breaches can result in:  
- Unauthorized control of your devices (e.g., unlocking your smart door).  
- Privacy violations, such as spying through cameras.  
- Compromised home networks, exposing sensitive personal or financial data.

By securing your IoT devices, you can safeguard your digital home and prevent cybercriminals from exploiting these vulnerabilities.

## üõ°Ô∏è What can I do?

### üü¢ Start Here (The Basics)

1. **Change Default Passwords Immediately**  
   Many devices come with factory-set passwords like ‚Äúadmin123.‚Äù Hackers can easily guess these.  
   - Replace default credentials with strong, unique passwords for every device.  

2. **Keep Devices Updated**  
   Regularly install firmware updates and security patches provided by manufacturers to address vulnerabilities.  
   - Enable automatic updates if available.  

3. **Set Up a Guest Network**  
   Isolate IoT devices on a dedicated Wi-Fi network separate from your primary devices (like phones and laptops).  
   - This limits potential lateral movement by hackers within your network.  

4. **Disable Unnecessary Features**  
   Turn off features like microphones, cameras, and remote access when they‚Äôre not in use.  

5. **Check App Permissions**  
   IoT devices often rely on companion apps. Review app permissions and follow the "rule of least privilege": only grant what‚Äôs absolutely necessary.  

### üîµ Want Extra Protection? (Leveling Up)

1. **Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**  
   For devices and apps that support it, enable MFA to add an extra layer of login security.  

2. **Monitor Your Network**  
   Use network monitoring tools like **Fing** or your router‚Äôs management interface to track connected devices.  
   - Look for any unfamiliar devices and disconnect them immediately.  

3. **Turn Off Universal Plug and Play (UPnP)**  
   UPnP is convenient for connecting devices but can be exploited by hackers. Disable it unless absolutely necessary.  

4. **Secure Your Router**  
   - Enable WPA3 or WPA2 encryption for your Wi-Fi.  
   - Change the default SSID to something non-identifiable (e.g., avoid "SmithFamilyWiFi").  
   - Refer to the [CISA Guide to Securing Home Networks](https://media.defense.gov/2023/Feb/22/2003165170/-1/-1/0/CSI_BEST_PRACTICES_FOR_SECURING_YOUR_HOME_NETWORK.PDF).  

5. **Research Before Buying**  
   Choose IoT devices from reputable manufacturers that prioritize security and provide regular updates.
