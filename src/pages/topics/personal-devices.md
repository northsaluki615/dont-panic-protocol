## 🛡️ What can I do?

### 🟢 Start Here (The Basics)
1. **Keep Software Updated**  
   Enable automatic updates for your operating system and apps. This ensures the latest security patches are installed.
   
2. **Use Strong, Unique Passwords**  
   Secure every account with a strong password—at least 16 characters, ideally managed by a password manager.
   
3. **Turn on MFA**  
   Add a second layer of security with multifactor authentication (MFA). It could be a code, biometric, or app-based authentication.

4. **Avoid Public Wi-Fi**  
   Public networks are vulnerable to hackers. Use a virtual private network (VPN) when connecting to public Wi-Fi.

5. **Install Security Software**  
   Use antivirus, anti-malware, and firewall software to provide a multi-layered defense against cyber threats.

### 🔵 Want Extra Protection? (Leveling Up)
1. **Secure IoT Devices**  
   Change default passwords, enable automatic updates, and disable features you don’t use.
   
2. **Encrypt Your Data**  
   Enable full-disk encryption on laptops, tablets, and mobile devices to protect data in case of loss or theft.

3. **Use Secure Messaging Apps**  
   Communicate via end-to-end encrypted apps like Signal to protect your conversations.

4. **Monitor Device Permissions**  
   Regularly review and restrict app permissions to limit access to your camera, microphone, or location.

5. **Segment Your Network**  
   Separate your home Wi-Fi into different networks for trusted devices, guests, and IoT devices.
