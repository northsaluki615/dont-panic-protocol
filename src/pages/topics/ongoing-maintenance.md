## üõ†Ô∏è What is it?

Ongoing maintenance involves routine actions to ensure your digital security remains effective. This includes keeping devices, software, and accounts updated, monitoring for threats, and maintaining a proactive stance against potential vulnerabilities.

---

## üö® Why is this important?

Cyber threats constantly evolve. Attackers target outdated software, exploit weak credentials, and breach unmonitored systems. Without regular maintenance:  
- Devices become vulnerable to malware and ransomware.  
- Unused accounts can provide entry points for hackers.  
- Critical data may be lost due to inadequate backup strategies.  

By committing to ongoing security practices, you significantly reduce the risk of breaches, data theft, and financial loss.

   - Enable **automatic updates** for your operating systems, apps, and devices.  
   - Regular updates patch vulnerabilities and defend against new threats.  
   - Prioritize updates for critical devices like routers and IoT devices.

2. **Backup Regularly**  
   - Schedule backups for essential files and ensure they occur automatically.  
   - Use **cloud services** like Google Drive or iCloud and external drives for redundancy.  
   - Follow the **3-2-1 rule**: 3 copies of data, 2 local on different devices, 1 offsite (cloud or external storage).  

3. **Monitor Accounts and Devices**  
   - Regularly review login attempts, connected devices, and app activity.  
   - Set up alerts for suspicious login attempts.  
   - Use tools like **Google Account Security Checkup** or **Microsoft Account Review**.

4. **Change Passwords Periodically**  
   - Rotate passwords for sensitive accounts (e.g., banking, email) at least annually.  
   - Use **password managers** like Bitwarden or 1Password to generate and store unique, strong passwords.  

5. **Review App and Device Permissions**  
   - Check permissions granted to apps and devices.  
   - Revoke access for outdated or unused apps and restrict excessive permissions to sensitive data.

### üîµ Want Extra Protection? (Leveling Up)

1. **Enable Security Notifications**  
   - Turn on notifications for suspicious activity from services like your bank, email provider, or social media accounts.  
   - Set up breach alerts through tools like **[Have I Been Pwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com)**.

2. **Run Routine Security Scans**  
   - Use trusted antivirus and anti-malware tools like **Malwarebytes** or **Norton Security** to detect threats.  
   - Schedule weekly scans for comprehensive protection.  

3. **Test Your Backups**  
   - Periodically restore files from backups to ensure they‚Äôre functional and complete.  
   - Label and organize backups for easy recovery during emergencies.  

4. **Secure Your Network**  
   - Remove old or unused devices from your home network.  
   - Regularly update your Wi-Fi password and enable **WPA3** encryption.  
   - Use advanced tools like **network segmentation** to separate devices like IoT gadgets from your primary network.  

5. **Stay Informed and Share Knowledge**  
   - Follow cybersecurity blogs or alerts (e.g., CISA or StaySafeOnline).  
   - Teach family members about secure practices, such as recognizing phishing emails or updating devices regularly.
