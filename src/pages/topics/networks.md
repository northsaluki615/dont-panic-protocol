## üõ†Ô∏è What is it?

Your home network is the backbone of your digital ecosystem, connecting devices like smartphones, smart TVs, and IoT gadgets to the internet. Your router acts as the central hub, managing this connection. However, if left unsecured, your network becomes an easy target for hackers, malware, and data theft.

## üö® Why is this important?

An unsecured network is a cybercriminal's playground. Once they gain access, they can:  
- Eavesdrop on private communications.  
- Steal sensitive data such as passwords and financial information.  
- Use your devices as a launchpad for larger attacks.  

Securing your network not only protects your devices but also safeguards your personal and financial information.

## üõ°Ô∏è What can I do?

### üü¢ Start Here (The Basics)

1. **Change Default Router Settings**  
   - Rename your network (SSID) to avoid revealing the router‚Äôs brand or model.  
   - Set a strong, unique admin password. Default credentials like ‚Äúadmin/admin‚Äù are easy for hackers to exploit.

2. **Enable WPA3 or WPA2 Security**  
   - Use **WPA3** for the latest and strongest encryption. If not available, opt for **WPA2**.  
   - Avoid outdated protocols like **WEP**, which are easy to crack.  

3. **Update Router Firmware Regularly**  
   - Router manufacturers release updates to fix security vulnerabilities. Check for updates in your router's admin settings.  

4. **Create a Guest Network**  
   - Allow visitors or IoT devices to connect to a separate network. This isolates them from your primary devices, reducing the risk of cross-network attacks.  

5. **Use Strong Network Passwords**  
   - Choose a password with at least **20 characters**, combining letters, numbers, and symbols.  
   - Avoid common passwords like "password123" or personal details like your name.

### üîµ Want Extra Protection? (Leveling Up)

1. **Enable Router Firewalls**  
   - Most modern routers come with built-in firewalls. Ensure this feature is activated to block unauthorized traffic.  

2. **Monitor Connected Devices**  
   - Regularly check which devices are connected to your network. Many routers have an interface to list connected devices‚Äîdisable any unknown ones.  

3. **Use a VPN at the Router Level**  
   - Set up a VPN on your router to encrypt all traffic coming from your network. This provides an additional layer of privacy for every connected device.  

4. **Disable WPS and Remote Management**  
   - Turn off Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS) and remote router access. Both features are prone to vulnerabilities that hackers can exploit.  

5. **Segment Your Network**  
   - Separate trusted devices, IoT gadgets, and guest users into different sub-networks. This prevents weaker devices, like older smart gadgets, from compromising your primary network.
