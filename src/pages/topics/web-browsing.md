## üõ†Ô∏è What is it?

Web browsing is the process of accessing and interacting with online content through browsers like Chrome, Firefox, or Safari. While it‚Äôs essential for work, entertainment, and research, web browsing also introduces risks such as phishing, malware infections, and data tracking by advertisers or malicious actors.

## üö® Why is this important?

Every website visit leaves a trail of digital breadcrumbs. Without protective measures:  
- Personal data can be stolen through phishing scams.  
- Malware can infect your devices via malicious ads or downloads.  
- Advertisers, ISPs, and even hackers can track your browsing habits to build detailed profiles or exploit vulnerabilities.

Safe web browsing practices help protect your privacy, data, and devices from these threats.

## üõ°Ô∏è What can I do?

### üü¢ Start Here (The Basics)

1. **Use a Secure Browser**  
   Choose browsers that prioritize privacy and security:  
   - **[Brave](https://brave.com):** Blocks ads and trackers by default.  
   - **[Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox):** Highly customizable with strong privacy add-ons.  
   - **[LibreWolf](https://librewolf.net):** A privacy-focused fork of Firefox.

2. **Check for HTTPS**  
   Always ensure the URL starts with **https://**, which encrypts your connection to the website. Avoid entering sensitive information on sites without this protection.

3. **Install Tracker Blockers**  
   Extensions like **[uBlock Origin](https://ublockorigin.com)** or **[Privacy Badger](https://privacybadger.org)** prevent ads and trackers from following your online activity.

4. **Beware of Pop-Ups and Ads**  
   Be cautious of pop-ups, especially those claiming urgent warnings. Use blockers like **uBlock Origin** to prevent malicious ads from loading.

5. **Avoid Public Wi-Fi Without Protection**  
   Public Wi-Fi networks are prone to eavesdropping. Always use a VPN like **[ProtonVPN](https://protonvpn.com)** to encrypt your internet traffic.

### üîµ Want Extra Protection? (Leveling Up)

1. **Enable Private Browsing**  
   Use incognito or private modes to prevent your browser from saving history, cookies, or search terms.  
   - Note: This doesn‚Äôt prevent tracking by your ISP or employer.

2. **Harden Your Browser Settings**  
   Adjust browser settings for enhanced security:  
   - Disable third-party cookies.  
   - Turn off JavaScript for unknown websites using tools like **[NoScript](https://noscript.net)**.  

3. **Clear Cookies and Cache Regularly**  
   Delete stored cookies, cache, and browsing history to reduce the risk of data accumulation by websites.

4. **Switch to Privacy-First Search Engines**  
   - **[DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com):** Avoids tracking and filtering search results based on personal data.  
   - **[Startpage](https://www.startpage.com):** Uses Google‚Äôs search results but anonymizes queries.  

5. **Inspect URLs for Phishing Attempts**  
   Hover over links before clicking to check the actual destination. Look for suspicious or misspelled domains (e.g., ‚Äúgooogle.com‚Äù instead of ‚Äúgoogle.com‚Äù).

6. **Consider Using Tor for Maximum Privacy**  
   Use the **[Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org)** to anonymize your browsing and access content without revealing your IP address.
