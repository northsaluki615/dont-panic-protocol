# About

Welcome to the Don’t Panic Protocol! Our mission is to make cybersecurity easy and accessible for everyone, from beginners to those looking to deepen their understanding of digital safety. Here, you’ll find simple guides, helpful resources, and practical advice to protect your online life without feeling overwhelmed.

## Inspiration

The idea for the Don’t Panic Protocol is inspired by **Douglas Adams’ “The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy.”** In the story, the guidebook has the comforting words “DON’T PANIC” on its cover, a reminder to approach challenges with calm and clarity. This project aims to bring that same approach to cybersecurity: no jargon, no panic, just straightforward steps to stay safe online.

In today’s digital world, everyone deserves to feel secure, regardless of technical background. The Don’t Panic Protocol was created to be a friendly, easy-to-use resource for everyday users and small business owners, with practical guidance and tools to tackle the most common security challenges.

## About the Creator

Hi, I’m Mike Helmers, the creator and developer of the Don’t Panic Protocol. I’m passionate about making technology and security accessible for everyone, especially those who may not have a technical background. Currently, I’m studying cybersecurity in graduate school and working in the field at Wisconsin Employee Trust Fund (ETF), where I focus on practical solutions to keep digital information secure.

In my free time, I enjoy playing Dungeons & Dragons and exploring how technology can enrich our lives. The Don’t Panic Protocol is my way of helping others feel more confident and secure in their digital spaces. If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to reach out to me at [helmmp15@uwgb.edu](mailto:helmmp15@uwgb.edu).

Thank you for visiting, and remember: don’t panic – you’ve got this!
