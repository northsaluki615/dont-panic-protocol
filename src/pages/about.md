Welcome to the **Don’t Panic Protocol**! 🌐 Our mission is to make cybersecurity easy and accessible for everyone, from beginners to those looking to deepen their understanding of digital safety. Here, you’ll find simple guides, helpful resources, and practical advice to protect your online life without feeling overwhelmed.

## 🌟 Inspiration

The idea for the Don’t Panic Protocol is inspired by **Douglas Adams’ “The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy.”** 📚 In the story, the guidebook has the comforting words “DON’T PANIC” on its cover, a reminder to approach challenges with calm and clarity. This project aims to bring that same approach to cybersecurity: no jargon, no panic, just straightforward steps to stay safe online. 🌈

In today’s digital world, everyone deserves to feel secure, regardless of technical background. The Don’t Panic Protocol was created to be a friendly, easy-to-use resource for everyday users and small business owners, with practical guidance and tools to tackle the most common security challenges. 🔐
